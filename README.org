* snobol-mode

This package provides a pretty bare-bones snobol4 major mode for Emacs.
Just enough to make using the language a little less awful.

** Installation

If you are on Emacs>=30, you can use the following `use-package` declaration:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package snobol-mode
   :vc (:url "https://github.com/ehawkvu/snobol-mode")
   :mode ("\\.sno" . snobol-mode))
#+end_src
